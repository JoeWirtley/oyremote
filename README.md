Since a number of people asked for the source code, I decided to post what I could find here. This is ancient, but it's all I could find of the original source. It's from version 0.11, so there are a number of bugfixes and features missing that were in 0.17a, which was the last official version.

Since I do not own an Onkyo receiver at the moment, there's little to encourage me to pick this up again - however, I'm hopeful that others may be able to make something of the code.

Cheers.
